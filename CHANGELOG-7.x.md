# CHANGELOG

## [7.0.0] (Unreleased)

The most notable change is that you need PHP 8.1/8.2 to use the new version. The language migration of
the SDK has introduced some breaking changes concerning parameter types, which should not affect your
project in most cases.

See **[UPGRADE-7.0](UPGRADE-7.0.md) for information about relevant changes between 6.x and 7.0.**
