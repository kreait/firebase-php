Overview

************
Requirements
************

* PHP >= 7.0
* The `mbstring PHP extension <http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php>`_
* A Firebase project - create a new project in the `Firebase console <https://firebase.google.com/console/>`_,
  if you don't already have one.
* A Google service account, follow the instructions in the
  `official Firebase Server documentation <https://firebase.google.com/docs/server/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app>`_
  and place the JSON configuration file somewhere in your project's path.

************
Installation
************

The recommended way to install the Firebase Admin SDK is with
`Composer <http://getcomposer.org>`_. Composer is a dependency management tool
for PHP that allows you to declare the dependencies your project needs and
installs them into your project.

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require kreait/firebase-php ^4.41


Alternatively, you can specify the Firebase Admin SDK as a dependency in your
project's existing composer.json file:

.. code-block:: js

    {
      "require": {
        "kreait/firebase-php": "^4.41"
      }
   }

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

You can find out more on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and
other best-practices for defining dependencies at
`getcomposer.org <http://getcomposer.org>`_.

Please continue to the :ref:`Setup section <setup>` to learn more about connecting your application to Firebase.

You can find more usage examples at
`https://github.com/jeromegamez/firebase-php-examples <https://github.com/jeromegamez/firebase-php-examples>`_
and in the `tests directory <https://github.com/kreait/firebase-php/tree/master/tests>`_
of this project's `GitHub repository <https://github.com/kreait/firebase-php/>`_.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

    use Kreait\Firebase\Factory;

    $factory = (new Factory)
        ->withServiceAccount('/path/to/google-service-account.json')
        // The following line is optional if the project id in your credentials file
        // is identical to the subdomain of your Firebase project. If you need it,
        // make sure to replace the URL with the URL of your project.
        ->withDatabaseUri('https://my-project.firebaseio.com');

    $database = $factory->createDatabase();

    $newPost = $database
        ->getReference('blog/posts')
        ->push([
            'title' => 'Post title',
            'body' => 'This should probably be longer.'
        ]);

    $newPost->getKey(); // => -KVr5eu8gcTv7_AHb-3-
    $newPost->getUri(); // => https://my-project.firebaseio.com/blog/posts/-KVr5eu8gcTv7_AHb-3-

    $newPost->getChild('title')->set('Changed post title');
    $newPost->getValue(); // Fetches the data from the realtime database
    $newPost->remove();

Guidelines
==========

#. The SDK utilizes PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-4, and PSR-7.
#. This SDK has a minimum PHP version requirement of PHP 7.0. Pull requests must
   not require a PHP version greater than PHP 7.0 unless the feature is only
   utilized conditionally.
#. All pull requests must include unit tests to ensure the change works as
   expected and to prevent regressions.

Running the tests
=================

The SDK is unit tested with PHPUnit. Run the tests using the Makefile:

.. code-block:: bash

    make tests

Coding standards
================

The SDK uses the `PHP Coding Standars Fixer <https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer>`_
to ensure a uniform coding style. Apply coding standard fixed using the Makefile:

.. code-block:: bash

    make cs

from the root of the project.
