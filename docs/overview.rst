************
Installation
************

The recommended way to install the Firebase Admin SDK is with
`Composer <http://getcomposer.org>`_. Composer is a dependency management tool
for PHP that allows you to declare the dependencies your project needs and
installs them into your project.

If you want to use the SDK within a Framework, please follow the installation instructions here:

- **Laravel**: `kreait/laravel-firebase <https://github.com/kreait/laravel-firebase>`_
- **Symfony**: `kreait/firebase-bundle <https://github.com/kreait/firebase-bundle>`_

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require kreait/firebase-php

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

You can find out more on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and
other best-practices for defining dependencies at
`getcomposer.org <http://getcomposer.org>`_.

Please continue to the :ref:`Setup section <setup>` to learn more about connecting your application to Firebase.
