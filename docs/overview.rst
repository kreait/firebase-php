Overview

************
Requirements
************

* PHP >= 7.0
* The `mbstring PHP extension <http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php>`_
* A Firebase project - create a new project in the `Firebase console <https://firebase.google.com/console/>`_,
  if you don't already have one.
* A Google service account, follow the instructions in the
  `official Firebase Server documentation <https://firebase.google.com/docs/server/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app>`_
  and place the JSON configuration file somewhere in your project's path.

************
Installation
************

The recommended way to install the Firebase Admin SDK is with
`Composer <http://getcomposer.org>`_. Composer is a dependency management tool
for PHP that allows you to declare the dependencies your project needs and
installs them into your project.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install Composer
    php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
    php composer-setup.php
    php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"

You can add the Firebase Admin SDK as a dependency using the composer.phar CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

    php composer.phar require kreait/firebase-php ^4.0


Alternatively, you can specify the Firebase Admin SDK as a dependency in your
project's existing composer.json file:

.. code-block:: js

    {
      "require": {
         "kreait/firebase-php": "^3.0"
      }
   }

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

You can find out more on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and
other best-practices for defining dependencies at
`getcomposer.org <http://getcomposer.org>`_.

Issues/Support

- Join the Firebase Community Slack at https://firebase-community.appspot.com, join the #php channel and look
  for @jeromegamez.

*******
Roadmap
*******

The following planned features are not in a particular order:

- Integration of `Firebase Storage <https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/>`_
- Automatic updates of `Firebase Rules <https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/>`_

  - Background:
    `Data must be indexed to be queriable or sortable <https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/indexing-data>`_.
    If you try to query a yet unindexed dataset, the Firebase REST API will return an error. With this feature, the
    SDK could execute an error, and if an error occurs, update the Firebase Rules as needed and retry.

- Support for listening to the
  `Firebase event stream <https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/database/#section-streaming>`_
- PHP Object Serialization and Deserialization
- Use parallel requests where possible to speed up operations

Guidelines
==========

#. The SDK utilizes PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-4, and PSR-7.
#. This SDK has a minimum PHP version requirement of PHP 7.0. Pull requests must
   not require a PHP version greater than PHP 7.0 unless the feature is only
   utilized conditionally.
#. All pull requests must include unit tests to ensure the change works as
   expected and to prevent regressions.

Running the tests
=================

The SDK is unit tested with PHPUnit. Run the tests using the Makefile:

.. code-block:: bash

    make tests

Coding standards
================

The SDK uses the `PHP Coding Standars Fixer <https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer>`_
to ensure a uniform coding style. Apply coding standard fixed using the Makefile:

.. code-block:: bash

    make cs

from the root of the project.
